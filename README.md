Instructions for running this analysis suite.

This code is designed to process and analyze files that have been generated by Suite2P following imaging of GCaMP signals. The general workflow looks something like this:

1) Image responses of GCaMP-expressing cells to various visual stimuli.
2) Convert the raw scanbox files to hdf5 files.
3) Run Suite2P on all the hdf5 files from an imaging session to generate fluorescence traces for each roi across all experiments. This way, responses from each roi/cell to all visual stimuli and under all conditions (i.e. control vs CNO) can be analyzed.
4) Process the mat file generated by Suite2P by running Suite2P_Analysis_Batch.m. This code creates data structures for all rois that are split according to the different experiments (i.e. different visual stimuli presented and/or imaging conditions).
5) Compile tuning properties for all rois from specific subsets of experiments by running Tuning_Analysis.m on the data structures generated in step 4. This code creates data structures containing preferred SF and TF as well as DSI, OSI, and preferred direction for each roi/cell. It is necessary to compile multiple experiments when doing this analysis because the full range of parameters tested are often collected over multiple experiments.
6) Compare rois/cells in control versus CNO by running Control_CNO_Compare_Compile.m
